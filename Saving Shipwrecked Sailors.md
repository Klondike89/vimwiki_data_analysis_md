=== Best Practices ===
- When importing modules into a program, the preferred order is
    - the Python Standard Library modules
    - third-party modules
    - user-defined modules
- Assign constants, as per PEP8 Python style guide
    - constant names should be all caps
    - this doesn't make the variables truly immutable
    - but it does alert other developers that they shouldn't change them
-
